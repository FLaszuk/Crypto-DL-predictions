# Crypto-DL-predictions
Trying to build a model to predict cryptocurrencies value in the future using Binance data.

Give your Binance API credentials:
apiKey = "***"
secretKey = "***"

Use "ETHUSDT_Conv1D_model_train.ipynb" to train the model for cryptocurrency pair of your choice.

Define the cryptocurrency pair you're interested in, like:
symbol = "ETHUSDT"
